 *
 * A Centrality measure that combines degree centrality and local clustering coefficient.
 * This helps lowering the centrality of hubs as they have low clustering coefficient -- their neighbors are not tied together.
 * It is computed by counting the number of triangles attached to a node, which is same as 2x(degree)x(degree-1)x(clustering_coefficient)  
 * weighted version is defined arbitrary, could be changed. 
 * One possible alternative is to implement it to match Clustering in weighted networks Tore Opsahl, however his definition ignores the weight on the 3rd edge
